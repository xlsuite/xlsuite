On Snow Leopard, If you having issues installing the mysql gem.

Try the following:

sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386" gem install mysql -- \
  --with-mysql-dir=/usr/local/mysql --with-mysql-lib=/usr/local/mysql/lib \
  --with-mysql-include=/usr/local/mysql/include


If this works, rerun bundle install..
Have  A Nice Day!
