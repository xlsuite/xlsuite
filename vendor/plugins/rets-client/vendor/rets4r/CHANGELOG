0.8.4
	Fixed auth issue with authenticate headers with spaces after commas. (Ken Wiesner, Scott Patterson)
	
0.8.3
	Added example #set_pre_request_block. (Franois Beausoleil)
	Allow a pre request block to be set for RETS4R::Client.  
		This allows the caller to change the request in any meaningful way, such as adding a 
		RETS-UA-Authorization header when appropriate. (Franois Beausoleil)
	Better response handling of HTTP errors. Response codes > 300 other than 401 now raise an 
		HTTPError exception that encapsulates the HTTPResponse object.
		401 errors raise a LoginError exception. (Scott Patterson)
	Added in RETS specification error messages to reference. (Scott Patterson)
	New Rakefile.  Install the rake gem and do 'rake test' to run the tests. (Franois Beausoleil)
	
0.8.2
	Added missing result parameter to Client#search's yield (Scott Patterson)
	Added 1.7 to supported list and default version (Franois Beausoleil)
	No longer sends empty (nil) headers (Franois Beausoleil)
	Added debugging to HTTP output. (Franois Beausoleil, Scott Patterson)
	Added support for multiple set-cookie headers in the server response (Franois Beausoleil)
	Added basic search example (Scott Patterson)
	Implied default value of \t in RETS4R::Client::Transaction#delimiter (Franois Beausoleil)
	#get_metadata now returns the block's value or the results. (Franois Beausoleil)
	Made sure #login always calls #logout if called with a block.  #login returns the block's value 
		instead of results. (Franois Beausoleil)
	New assertions that require Client to have Ruby-like accessors for attributes, instead of 
		getters and setters.  Applied 'Rename Attribute' on @parser, because #get_parser_class 
		was returning the class of the parser's class, instead of the parser's class itself. (Franois Beausoleil)
	Client#set_rets_version should take care to generate the correct RETS-Version header, 
		and #get_rets_version should undo the changes that #set_rets_version did before 
		returning the value. (Franois Beausoleil)
	Don't rescue an exception that's not being processed in Parser. (Franois Beausoleil)
	RETS4R::Client#get_object extensions: yield or return the array of DataObject instances; 
		changed the multipart/parallel response boundary processing rules 
		(include \r\n in the boundary detection); added documentation. (Franois Beausoleil)
	Added GetObject example (Scott Patterson)
	Changed #get_object now yields each DataObject if a block is given rather 
		than an array of DataObjects (Scott Patterson)
	
0.8.1
	Added Action-URL support per the specification.
	Added a secondary_response accessor to the Transaction object, which is what the Action-URL result is stored in.
	Fixed a bug with loggers and parsers
	
0.8.0
	Fixed RParser support, which now means you can use REXML.
	RParser now retries XML that produced a parser error after trying to clean it.
	Parser support is now more open so that more parsers can be easily added in the future.
	Reorganized parser file layout.
	CParser will only be loaded if libxml (its dependency) is present. If it is, it is the default
		parser.
	Added more parser unit tests.
	Renamed CParser to XMLParser and RPARSER to REXML, both with the hierarchy RETS4R::Client::Module.
	Fixed a bug with the parser output not being set properly.
	Fixed a bug with the parser not respecting the DELIMITER value and insisting on tab delimiters.
	Added support for using a logger
	Added more defaults to the search options (Count => '0', Format => 'COMPACT')
	Added some Rubyisms (blocks can now be given to #new, #login, #get_metadata, #get_object, and #search)
	
0.7.1
	Added support for reading the results count for searches.
	
0.7.0
	Initial GEM Version
