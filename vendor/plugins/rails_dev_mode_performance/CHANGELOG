0.6.1 - Nov 9, 2008

* add auto reload to TemplateFinder so if it doesn't find a view in it's cached 
  directory scan then it will try again before failing

0.6 - Nov 8, 2008

* updated to work with rails 2.1.2



OLD Rails 1.2x version

* don't got thru all of ObjectSpace unless the constant we are removing actually derives from AR and might need the association patch ups
* store the new timestamp when a file changes, don't just remove the old one
* handle deleted files better
* add a .dup call to prevent trying to modify a hash during iteration
* remove files from the hash when deleted, not just nil the timestamp

0.5 - August 30, 2007

* adding documentation
* piggyback on included to know which modules depend on which other modules
* switch to using a hash and :defines or :related to determine a files relation to objects
* when removing an object see which file defines it and remove any objects associated with that file as well

The last is for edge cases...

AccountController < AppController 
(this is tracked at the object level)

AccountController has AccountHelper
(this is tracked at the file level)

AccountHelper include FakeHelper
(this is tracked at the object level)

The problem is if I edit account_helper it knows I need to reload account controller... but if I edit fake_helper only account_helper is reloading because the account_helper file wasn't actually changed it didn't know to reload app controller as well.  So now file associations are checked as well to catch these edge cases.

0.4 - August 29, 2007

* keep track some depends by hooking depend_on (this lets us now reload controllers when referenced helpers are modified)

0.3.3 - August 29, 2007

* remove hack introduced in 0.3.2 to deal with ApplicationController and add true dependency tracking for classes as they are auto-loaded... and then removing them recursively when a top-level class is unloaded

0.3.2 - August 29, 2007

* apply a fix to nil out @through_reflection and @source_reflection that seems to fix an infinite looping problem corp was seeing
* nil out @primary_key_name and @association_foreign_key as well
* nil out @class_name and @table_name in reflections
* completely evil hack to flush all the controllers if we've edited ApplicationController 

0.3.1 - August 29,2007

* put clear_reloadable_connections back into reset_app! as it may sometimes be needed for sqlite3 (to recognize schema changes?)

0.3 - August 29, 2007

* pull in reset_application! and hack it to do less (less is more, right?)
** comment out the removing of Reloadable classes, this is depreciated anyways and very slow according to benchmarking 
** comment out the clearing of reload-able connections, this probably has it's uses but doesn't sound like something that should be happening on EVERY request

0.2.1 - August 28, 2007

* prevent autoload_module from adding modules to the list on constants to be unloaded if our file dependency code is already tracking them for smart unloading

0.2 - August 28, 2007

* Adding support to only reload routes.rb if it has changed from the last request

0.1 - August 28, 2007

* Initial release
