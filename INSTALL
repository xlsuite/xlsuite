= Basic Installation

XLsuite is built on-top of MySQL and cannot currently use any other database servers.

1. cp config/database.yml.sample config/database.yml
2. Edit config/database.yml to suit you (must use MySQL)
**3. bundle install **
4. rake db:create db:structure:load db:bootstrap
5. script/server
6. http://localhost:3000/

= Complete Installation
Please note that I have this tested for **Ruby Enterprise Edition**

If bundler is blowing up on you with the mysql gem, please see the MYSQL_GEM_INSTALL_NOTES

Also, make sure that the mysql binary is in PATH.
I know this sounds stupid, but I have seen servers before that when you did this:

$mysql
mysql: command not found

Yet mysql was actually installed.
If this is you, google is your friend. This issue is outside the scope of installing this beast of a rails app. Don't get me wrong, it is a great program, it is just big.

You will need to register an account at Amazon's Web Services to use the Simple Storage Service (S3).  XLsuite stores it's assets in S3.  You may configure Asset to store the files on the local filesystem by changing the :storage key of the #has_attachment call to :file_system.

If you want to integrate with Google Maps, you'll need a Google Maps API key.  Update the Configuration named :google_maps_api_key with your key.

= Running the tests
